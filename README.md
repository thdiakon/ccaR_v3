## Overview

ccaR package provides functions for assessing and depicting primary study overlap across multiple reviews. The functions may be useful for methodologists and overview authors in exploring and communicating the degree of overlap in overview of reviews.

## Installation

``` r
# You can download the development version of the package from github:
devtools::install_github('thdiakon/ccaR_v3')

```

## Read the data

```
# Read the data
DATASET <- readr::read_delim(system.file('extdata','test.csv', package = 'ccaR'), delim = ";")

```

## Overall CCA

```
# Calculate the overall CCA (for the entire ciattion matrix)
cca(DATASET)
```



## CCA Table

```
# Create a summary table with pairwise and overall CCA 
tb <- cca_table(DATASET)
```

## Visualization of the pairwise CCA(%) with a heatmap

```
# Create a pairwise heatmap with CCA(%)
cca_heatmap(DATASET)
```
